<h1><u>Add a TAO Resource catalog entry</u></h1><br/>

<table border="1" width="700px" cellpadding="10px"><tr><td>Resources are content: information the teacher wants to bring into the 
course.  These can be prepared files uploaded to the course 
server; pages edited directly in Moodle; or external web pages
made to appear part of this course. <br/><br/>

TAO Resources are course independent, and are created in advance before being attached to a Course. <br/><br/>

Resources are either URLs, or a locally uploaded file.  Specify your resource, along with the appropriate metadata, to add it to the searchable index.
